Welcome to Malty<sup>TM</sup>, a unique beer application developed by Caleb Davenport and Min Seo. 

## Introduction

Why waste money on beers that you might not end up liking because of its taste, 
hops, or low/high alcohol content? Whether you call yourself a beer connoisseur or a young college
student, we all have our unique taste palate that distinguishes five basic taste 
characteristics -- sweet, bitter, sour, salty, and savory (umami). Beer review sites
are great but raise expectations of beers that you might not end up enjoying after 
long hours of studying/working, or during a beer shower. 

This is where Malty<sup>TM</sup> comes in! A web application that provides unique information
about users' beer profiles based on his/her choice of beers and brewers. Our Malty Beer 
application targets all kinds of beer enthusiasts to enjoy myriad of beers based on 
their taste preferences.

The application is easy to use. Simply enter the name of beer or brewery you like, 
and add to your profile. The application will then gather information about your favorites and
provide recommendations for you to try out!

This application is community-driven and will require usersâ€™ inputs and reviews in order to 
improve our beer suggestion database. You must be at least 21 years old to use this application.
We do not encourage underaged consumers!
