Welcome to Beer application, which is built by Caleb Davenport and Min Seo. 

This project focuses on all things beer by consuming two APIs to provide 
beer information.

The purpose of this project is to build a web application that allows users 
to search for a brewery or beer of his/her choice and provide users unique 
information about their beer profiles. Our Beer application targets all kinds 
of beer enthusiasts to enjoy myriad of beers based on their taste preferences. 
This application is community-driven and will require usersâ€™ input in order to 
improve our beer suggestion database.
